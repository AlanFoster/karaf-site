The Karaf team is pleased to announce the availability of [Karaf 2.2.2|index/community/download/karaf-2.2.2-release.html].

It contains bug fixes identified in the prior release, and introduces improvements including; improved behavior for the OracleDB locking mechanism and http feature jetty port usage. Several improvements to the shell have been incorporated, such as completion for shell aliases and a warning on osgi:shutdown to avoid inadvertently shutting down the container. There has also been a few small dependency upgrades to felix event admin, Pax URL, and jetty.
