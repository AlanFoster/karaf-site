The Karaf team is pleased to announce the availability of [Karaf 2.2.6|index/community/download/karaf-2.2.6-release.html].
This release of Apache Karaf is based off of the 2.2.x series branch, representing an update to Apache Karaf 2.2.5. It contains bug fixes identified in the prior release, and introduces improvements including; improved Windows, AIX, HP-UX, and Solaris support in the service wrapper, three new deployer demos showing how to make an OSGi bundle, a features file, and how to wrap a third party jar into a bundle, and support for ssh public key authentication and agent forwarding. A few new commands also appear in this release including; features:status to indicate feature loaded or not, feature:chooseurl to make it easy to install well known feature files, and a watch command to allow users to watch the output of a karaf command like when using the unix watch mechanism. Several dependencies were also updated, bringing Spring to 3.0.7-RELEASE, eventadmin to 1.2.14, Apache Pom to version 10, the maven bundle plugin to 2.3.7, and fileinstall to 3.2.0.
For more information, please see the [release notes|index/community/download/karaf-2.2.6-release.html].
