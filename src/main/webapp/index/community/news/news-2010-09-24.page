h1. Jamie Goodyear posted on Sep 24, 2010\\Karaf 2.1.0 released

The Karaf team is pleased to announce the availability of [Karaf 2.1.0|http://karaf.apache.org/download.html] .
New to this release of Apache Karaf is a JAAS Database Login Module, a  way to store passwords in a secured way, a mechanism that allows a karaf  application to distinguish between UserPrincipal and RolePrincipal  without depending from the Karaf JAAS Module.
The shell console has been enhanced to be available in a plain  non-OSGi environment and smart tab completion has been improved, along  with various commands.
We have also resolved a number of outstanding issues, and improved  support on OS X and IBM Java based systems.
For more information, please see the [release notes|http://karaf.apache.org/karaf-210-release.html] .
