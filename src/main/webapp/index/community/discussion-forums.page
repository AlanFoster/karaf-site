h2. Discussion Forums

Before posting you might want to read the [Tips for getting help].

Many users prefer to use online forums rather than joining a mail list which can lead to lots more email traffic so we use the online forums at [Nabble forums|http://karaf.922171.n3.nabble.com/] which also work with our [Mailing Lists] so that both stay completely in sync. Use either the mailing lists or online forums, its completely up to you.

If you prefer to use a mailing list instead then check out our [Mailing Lists]. Note that the Forums and [Mailing Lists] are kept in sync so its your choice which you use.
