h2. How do I choose between Felix and Equinox?

You can choose the OSGi framework you want to run Karaf on very easily.
Simply edit the {{etc/config.properties}} file and modify the {{karaf.framework}} property to either {{felix}} or {{equinox}}.
Then [restart Karaf from a clean state|How do I restart from a clean state].
