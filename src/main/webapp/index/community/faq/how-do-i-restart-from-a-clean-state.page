h2. How do I restart from a clean state?

Restarting Karaf from a clean state is very easy as Karaf stores all its working files in the {{data}} directory.
Removing this directory and starting Karaf should bring you in the original state.

You can also pass the {{clean}} argument on the command line to have it delete the {{data}} directory before starting.
