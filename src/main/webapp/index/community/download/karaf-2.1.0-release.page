h2. Release Notes - Karaf - Version 2.1.0

  New to this release of Apache Karaf is a JAAS Database Login Module, a way to store passwords in a secured way, a mechanism that allows a karaf application to distinguish between UserPrincipal and RolePrincipal without depending from the Karaf JAAS Module. 
  The shell console has been enhanced to be available in a plain non-OSGi environment and smart tab completion has been improved, along with various commands. 
  We have also resolved a number of outstanding issues, and improved support on OS X and IBM Java based systems. For more detail please see the change log below.

    * [KARAF-146|http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KARAF-146] - osgi:list should only print out 'system' bundles above a certain level, by default, this should be 50, but it should be configurable

    * [KARAF-152|http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KARAF-152] - when using the @Argument annotation, if there is no name specified it would be nice to reuse the name of the field, rather than use VAL
    * [KARAF-155|http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KARAF-155] - optional @Argument values (and I guess @Option values) can have default values which could be displayed in the help screen by reflecting into the value and finding non-zero/null values

    * [KARAF-208|http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KARAF-208] - when reusing the karaf shell outside of OSGi where there's only one shell scope, it would be nice to avoid prefixing the command names with the scope or with "*:" which is confusing
