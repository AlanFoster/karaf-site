Apache Karaf Cellar is a clustering solution based on Hazelcast for Karaf.
It has been added as a Karaf sub-project.
The following new releases haven been voted:
   * Apache Karaf 2.2.0
   * Apache Karaf 2.2.1
   * Apache Karaf 2.1.5
Karaf manuals (user guide and developer guide) are generated in the build
using Scalate.
The website is also managed using Scalate.
A new logo for Karaf has been voted and is used.
We are working on a bunch of enhancements in Karaf 3.0.0.
Branding
========
 * trademarks: not really compliant here
 * logo: a Karaf logo is now in use
 * metadata: we have a registered doap file

Apache Karaf provides higher level features and services 
specifically designed for creating OSGi-based servers.

Community
=========
We've voted in 3 new committers:
 * Adrian Trenaman
 * Achim Nierbeck
 * ?ukasz Dywicki
One committer has been invited to the PMC:
 * Ioannis Cannellos

Development
===========
Two releases have been voted on:
 * Apache Karaf 2.1.1 on November 14th, 2010
 * Apache Karaf 2.1.2 on November 25th, 2010

We're working towards the 2.2.0 release, currently
targetted  for January. It has been delayed because
we're waiting for Aries to release a new version.

We've voted a new logo and are discussing a possible 
web site design change.  We're also planning to move
out of confluence for the website, possibly using
Scalate.

Branding
========
 * project website basics: home page is ok
 * website nav links: we're missing nearly all the links 
   but the one to the main ASF web site
 * trademarks: not really compliant here
 * logo: not really compliant yet
 * metadata: we have a registered doap file

Issues for board consideration
==============================
None so far.  The community is growing and healthy.
We have currently two active contributors that aren't yet
committers.

h2. September 2010

{code}
Community
=========
We added the following committers:
 *  Hiram Chirino
 *  James Strachan
 *  Ioannis Canellos
James and Hiram were committers before we moved to TLP and asked 
to get their committership back, so they've been voted in back.  
Ioannis is a new Apache committer.
We also have other active contributors, so we expect some new
committers in the coming months.

Development
===========
No releases this month so far, but development continues towards 
our next point release of Karaf, with attention coming from users 
testing new features and suggesting improvements. We expect to 
release this new version before the end of the month.

h2. August 2010

{code}
Since the last July report, Apache Karaf 2.0.0 has been released.

Several patches have been supplied by contributors, but due to the 
holiday season, development has slowed down a bit during the past 
weeks.
{code}

h2. July 2010

{code}
It has been only a few weeks since the Karaf TLP has been established,
but the activity level is very high.   All resources have been set up
by infra (thx) and we have moved the opened JIRA issues and svn tree
from Felix to Karaf.

We've already received some patches from non developers, so I expect
the community to grow very soon.

We haven't released anything yet, and we're waiting for trunk to 
stabilize before releasing a 2.0 (new major version due to package
renaming).
