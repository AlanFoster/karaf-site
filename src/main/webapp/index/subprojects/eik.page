h2. Eclipse Integration for Karaf (EIK) 

Apache Karaf EIK (Eclipse Integration for Karaf) is the integration of the Apache Karaf
container and the Eclipse IDE.

Notable features include:

- Custom Eclipse perspective for Apache Karaf development: 
-- places valuable Karaf runtime information in one location
- Apache Karaf installation management in your workspace:
-- Karaf installations are managed as workspace projects giving the developer visibility in to the runtime
-- each Karaf installation is automatically synchronized with your workspace, including additional bundles, configuration files
- Run and debug Karaf installations with a single Eclipse Launcher:
-- the launch configuration allows developers to fine tune how Karaf will launch
- Automatic deployment of workspace plugin projects:
-- create plugin-projects and have them deployed automatically
- Advanced instrumentation of the running Karaf instance:
-- watch bundles deploy in real time and examine the OSGi service registry from within the Eclipse IDE
- Access Eclipse platform IDE plugins from within a running Karaf instance:
-- all Eclipse plugins are presented as an OBR
