h2. Karaf WebConsole

Karaf WebConsole is a refactoring of the Felix WebConsole. Karaf WebConsole is powered by Apache Wicket, in a pure OSGi way using Pax Wicket.

Thanks to Wicket and OSGi, Karaf WebConsole is highly configurable and extendable allowing legacy projects to provide WebConsole extensions.

h2. Quick Start

To install and start WebConsole into a running Karaf instance, you have to intall the WebConsole feature:

{code}
karaf@root> feature:add-url mvn:org.apache.karaf.webconsole/apache-karaf-webconsole/0.3.0-SNAPSHOT/xml/features
karaf@root> feature:install webconsole-wicket
{code}

You can open the WebConsole CMS URL in your browser:

{code}
http://localhost:8181/cms
{code}
